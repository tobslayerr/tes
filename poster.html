        The poster design above captures the essence of the storyline from "The Regrets of Da," set in the culturally rich areas of Semarang Chinatown and Sam Poo Kong. These locations are renowned for their traditional architecture, which remains largely preserved and serves as a major attraction for tourists. Semarang Chinatown and Sam Poo Kong are not just historically significant, but they also offer a glimpse into the enduring cultural heritage of the region.

        The use of red in the poster is particularly striking, as it symbolizes courage and strength, key themes in the storyline. Red is a color deeply embedded in Chinese culture, often representing luck, prosperity, and celebration, adding layers of meaning to the artistic depiction. The design elements of the poster, therefore, not only provide visual appeal but also enhance the storytelling by connecting the viewer to the historical and cultural backdrop of the tale. The traditional buildings in these areas, with their intricate designs and historical significance, help in creating an immersive experience for those engaging with the story.
